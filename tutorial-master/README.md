#Complete CodeBase
This is the accompanying complete codebase and resulting app from the Kinect 2 tutorials.

To see the tutorials, visit the gh-pages branch which contains all the documentations to complete this app yourself.

The other branch "labs" is considered the release branch and each lab links to a release in that branch which contains
the project at that stage in the series.

Please use the issue tracking on this page to give any feedback or if you have any questions.
